# Project description

Our goal is to create a library website that serves as a storage for books and movies. The website should provide a list of authors and the ability to get a book delivered to the user's home. Additionally, users should be able to mark a book as lost and view their checkout history.

## Key features, including:

* A user-friendly interface that allows users to easily search for and access books and movies.
* An online checkout system that allows users to order books and movies for delivery to their home.
* A book tracking system that allows users to mark books as lost or damaged, and to view their checkout history.
* A database of books and movies that includes information about authors, titles, and other relevant details.

To ensure that the website meets the needs of our users, we will conduct extensive user research and testing throughout the development process. This will include usability testing, surveys, and other feedback mechanisms to gather input from our target audience.

Our project following an Agile methodology, with iterative sprints and regular team meetings to track progress and address any issues that arise. We are committed to delivering a high-quality library website that meets the needs of our users and helps promote the joy of reading and watching movies.
